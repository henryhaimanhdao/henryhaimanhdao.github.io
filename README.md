## 1. d (Paragraph on describing background process of querying products and sending orders to the Fast food restaurant)
* In the beginning, when clients pull up the order menu, they will input what order they want. The system will check the order data, validate the data, then display that data for the client. After, the client will validate/confirm the order data and finally the system will store the client’s order data into the app’s database. Depending on what the client ordered, the order data will be sent to restaurants that had their food item(s) chosen and their system will display that order data to them.
